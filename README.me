# ðŸ¤– OpenAI Agents SDK Lab

Welcome to my exploration lab for the **[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)** â€” a framework for building agentic AI systems with tool usage, step-based reasoning, and customizable context.

This repository is focused on **hands-on experimentation**, **source code understanding**, and building **shareable agentic AI prototypes** using the SDK.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Understand core SDK concepts like:
  - `Agent`, `Runner`, `Tool`, and `Context`
  - Tool-calling lifecycle and Observations
- Dive into SDK source code and answer architectural questions
- Build reusable agent templates and custom tools
- Create real-world, LinkedIn-worthy projects using agentic workflows

---

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Practicing

- âœ… Dynamic system instructions with callable prompts
- âœ… Classmethod-based agent execution via `Runner.run(...)`
- âœ… Context-aware generics using `TContext`
- âœ… Tool registration and streaming outputs
- âœ… Multi-step agent flows with memory/state
